# **Karmatek-2025-Organa**
## Smart Organ & Blood Donation Network 🩺🩸

Welcome to the Karmatek-2025-Organa repository, a futuristic platform that revolutionizes organ and blood donation through the power of technology! Our smart network connects organ and blood donors with recipients using a sophisticated scoring algorithm and generative AI for optimized matches and in-depth analysis. 🌟

### 🚀 Features
- **Scoring Algorithm:** Our innovative scoring algorithm ensures the best matches between donors and recipients based on various factors.
- **Generative AI:** Utilizing cutting-edge generative AI technology to enhance the matching process and provide insightful analysis.
- **FastAPI Backend:** The backend is powered by FastAPI, a modern web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.
- **Next.js Frontend:** The frontend is developed using Next.js, a popular React framework with server-side rendering support.
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Data is stored and managed efficiently in a PostgreSQL database to ensure scalability and reliability.
- **Pydantic Validation:** Pydantic is used for data parsing and validation to maintain data integrity and improve error handling.
- **Secure UI Design:** A visually appealing and user-friendly UI design using Shadcn UI components and Tailwind CSS.
- **Real-Time Communication:** Integration of Socket.IO and WebSocket for real-time updates and communication.
- **Data Persistence:** SQLAlchemy is employed for data persistence, making it easy to work with the database using Python objects.
- **State Management:** Zustand is used for state management in the frontend to handle complex application states.
- **Form Validation:** Zod validation library is implemented for robust form validation to prevent errors and ensure data accuracy.
